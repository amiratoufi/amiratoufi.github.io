    "body": "The abyssal ocean is marked by intense turbulence driven by a complex interplay of forces. Abyssal ocean turbulence arises primarily from gravitational forces acting on density differences in seawater due to variations in temperature and salinity as well as internal tides pushing seawater to move up and down sloping topography. At the ocean floor, interactions between the moving water above and the topography below create turbulent eddies and mixing processes known as bottom boundary layer turbulence. This turbulence enhances the vertical exchange of properties such as heat, carbon, and nutrients between the deep ocean and the overlying water masses. In abyssal ocean circulation, dense, cold water sinks near polar regions and spreads along the ocean floor towards equatorial regions, driven by differences in temperature and salinity. This deep water movement, facilitated by bottom boundary layer processes, is a key component of the global ocean overturning circulation. It regulates Earth's climate by redistributing heat and nutrients on a planetary scale, influencing weather patterns and the stability of marine ecosystems. Understanding abyssal ocean turbulence and circulation is thus essential for comprehending the dynamics of Earth's climate system and its responses to environmental changes.",

    "body": "Stably stratified exchange flow occurs when two fluid layers of different densities interact, with the denser layer underlying the lighter one due to gravitational settling, leading to a stable density gradient. This phenomenon is crucial in understanding the dynamics of fluids in various natural and engineered systems, including estuaries, straits, building ventilation systems, and climate mitigation strategies. The stratified inclined duct (SID) sustains an exchange flow in a long, gently sloping duct as a model for continuously forced density-stratified flows such as those found in estuaries. Experiments have shown that the emergence of interfacial waves and their transition to turbulence as the tilt angle is increased appears to be linked to a threshold in the exchange flow rate given by inviscid two-layer hydraulics. We uncover these hydraulic mechanisms by (i) using recent direct numerical simulations (DNS) providing full flow data in the key flow regimes (Zhu et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 969, 2023, A20), (ii) averaging these DNS into two layers, and (iii) using an inviscid two-layer shallow-water and instability theory to diagnose interfacial wave behavior and provide physical insight. The laminar flow is subcritical and stable throughout the duct and hydraulically controlled at the ends of the duct. As the tilt is increased, the flow becomes supercritical everywhere and unstable to long waves. An internal jump featuring stationary waves first appears near the center of the duct, then leads to larger-amplitude traveling waves, and to stronger jumps, wave breaking, and intermittent turbulence at the largest tilt angle. Long waves described by the (nonlinear) shallow-water equation are interpreted locally as linear waves on a two-layer parallel base flow described by the Taylor–Goldstein equation. This link helps us to interpret long-wave instability and contrast it with short-wave (e.g., Kelvin–Helmholtz) instability. Our results suggest a transition to turbulence in SID through long-wave instability relying on vertical confinement by the top and bottom walls.",

    "title": "Atmospheric Boundary Layers Turbulence",
    "hero": "/ejection.jpg",
    "body": "The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is the lowest part of the atmosphere, directly influenced by the Earth's surface. It typically extends from a few hundred meters to a couple of kilometers above the surface, depending on various factors such as terrain, weather conditions, and time of day. The ABL is crucial for understanding weather patterns, climate, and air quality, as it mediates exchanges of momentum, heat, and mass between the surface and the free atmosphere. Within the ABL, turbulence is a key process, driving the mixing of air masses and influencing weather and climate. However, when the ABL is stably stratified, such as during nighttime cooling or under high-pressure systems, the nature of turbulence is significantly altered. A classic example of stably stratified turbulence in the ABL is the nocturnal boundary layer (NBL). After sunset, the ground cools rapidly through radiative loss, leading to the formation of a surface inversion where temperature increases with height. This creates a stable stratification, reducing vertical mixing and allowing pollutants to accumulate near the surface. In the NBL, turbulence is generally weaker and more intermittent compared to the daytime convective boundary layer. The suppression of vertical mixing leads to the formation of a low-level jet, a narrow region of strong winds that can enhance horizontal transport of momentum and scalar quantities. Observing and modeling stably stratified turbulence in the ABL poses significant challenges due to its intermittent and anisotropic nature. Traditional turbulence models, often based on the assumption of isotropy, may not adequately capture the complexities of stratified turbulence. Advanced measurement techniques, such as high-resolution remote sensing and tower-based observations, are crucial for studying these phenomena. Numerical models, ranging from large-eddy simulations (LES) to direct numerical simulations (DNS), are employed to understand stably stratified turbulence. These models incorporate buoyancy effects and stratification to simulate the flow dynamics accurately. However, the high computational cost of resolving fine-scale structures and wave-turbulence interactions remains a challenge. Understanding stably stratified turbulence in the ABL has profound implications for various fields such as Weather Forecasting: Accurate representation of stable stratification and associated turbulence is essential for weather prediction models, particularly for nighttime weather phenomena and stable high-pressure systems. Climate Modeling: Long-term climate simulations must account for the effects of stably stratified turbulence on heat and moisture transport within the ABL. Air Quality: Stable stratification can lead to poor air quality by trapping pollutants near the surface. Understanding the dynamics of stably stratified turbulence helps in predicting pollution dispersion and formulating mitigation strategies. Aviation Safety: Internal gravity waves and turbulence in stably stratified layers pose risks to aviation. Improved modeling and forecasting of these phenomena can enhance flight safety. In this paper, the kinetic energy cascade in stably stratified open-channel flows is investigated. A mathematical framework to incorporate vertical scales into the conventional kinetic energy spectrum and its budget is introduced. This framework defines kinetic energy density in horizontal spectral and vertical scale space. The energy cascade is studied by analyzing the evolution of kinetic energy density. It is shown that energetic streamwise scales (λx) become larger with increasing vertical scale. For the strongest stratification, for which the turbulence becomes intermittent, the energetic streamwise scales are suppressed, and energy density resides in λx of the size of the domain. It is shown that, in an unstratified case, vertical scales of the size comparable to the height of the logarithmic layer connect viscous regions to the outer layer. By contrast, in stratified cases, such a connection is not observed. Moreover, it is shown that nonlinear transfer for streamwise scales is dominated by in-plane triad interactions and inter-plane transfer is more active in transferring energy density among small vertical scales of the size comparable to the height of viscous sublayer. The vertical scales of size comparable to the height of the viscous sublayer and buffer layer are the most active scales in the viscous term and the production term in the energy density budget, respectively.",
