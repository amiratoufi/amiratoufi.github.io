The abyssal ocean is a dynamic environment marked by intense turbulence and complex mixing processes driven by variations in temperature, salinity, and internal tides. This turbulence results from gravitational forces acting on density differences in seawater, causing water to move up and down along sloping bottom topagraphy. When this movement interacts with the rough topography, it generates turbulent eddies and mixing processes, known as bottom boundary layer turbulence. This mixing facilitates the crucial exchange of heat, carbon, and nutrients between the deep ocean and the upper layers, impacting both marine ecosystems and clmate regulations.

In abyssal ocean circulation, cold, dense water forms near polar regions, sinking and spreading along the ocean floor toward the equator, driven by density gradients. This movement, sustained by bottom boundary layer turbulence, contributes to the global ocean overturning circulation—a system redistributing heat and nutrients on a planetary scale. This circulation influences weather, marine ecosystem stability, and Earth's climate by acting as a long-term sink for carbon and heat.

As interest in deep-sea mining grows, scientists are increasingly concerned about its potential impact on abyssal turbulence and the ecosystems it sustains. The ocean floor contains valuable resources like manganese nodules and cobalt-rich crusts, which are essential for various technologies. However, mining these resources could disrupt sediment layers, increase local turbidity, and alter natural mixing processes, affecting the delicate balance of nutrient distribution and the overall health of deep-sea habitats.

Studying abyssal turbulence and the effects of human activities like deep-sea mining is crucial for understanding and protecting the deep ocean’s role in global climate stability and marine biodiversity.
