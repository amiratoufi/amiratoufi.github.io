            I am a Research Associate in the Department of Earth Sciences at the
            University of Cambridge, specializing in geophysical fluid dynamics
            with a focus on boundary layer processes. My research combines
            theory, numerical simulations, laboratory experiments, and
            mathematical analysis to better understand complex geophysical
            flows. Before joining Earth Sciences, I worked as a postdoctoral
            research associate in the Department of Applied Mathematics and
            Theoretical Physics (DAMTP) as part of the Atmosphere-Ocean Dynamics
            Group and the G.K. Batchelor Laboratory.
            <br />
            <br />
            I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Waterloo, where I focused
            on turbulence in stably stratified boundary layers, particularly in
            contexts similar to nocturnal atmospheric boundary layers. During my
            postdoctoral studies at DAMTP, I contributed to the ERC-funded STAMP
            (Stratified Turbulence and Mixing Processes) project, investigating
            the relationship between internal hydraulics and mixing in
            stratified exchange flows, such as those found in estuaries and
            straits.
            <br />
            <br />
            My current research centers on abyssal ocean turbulence,
            specifically exploring interactions between tides and bottom
            boundary layer processes, including upwelling and downwelling.

          <p className="text-center md:text-left p-4">
            I hold an MSc in Aerodynamics from K. N. Toosi University of
            Technology, where my thesis focused on compressible turbulent mixing
            using large eddy simulations (LES). I also have a BSc in Mechanical
            Engineering. After completing my Masterâ€™s, I worked in the offshore
            oil and gas industry, gaining broad experience in roles such as
            mechanical engineer, projects coordinator, hydrodynamic analyst,
            computational fluid dynamics (CFD) engineer, engineering
            coordinator, and project manager.
